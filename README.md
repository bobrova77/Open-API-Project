# The Star Wars API

## Description

The Star Wars API is a web application that allows users to search for and learn about all the Star Wars data you've ever wanted: Planets, Spaceships, Vehicles, People, Films and Species. Now with The Force Awakens data!

## Features

- Search for the Star Wars data
- Display detailed information (Planets, Spaceships, Vehicles, People, Films and Species, etc.)
- View random Star Wars images
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Internet connection (for API calls)
- A text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text) if you want to make changes!

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bobrova77/Open-API-Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd bobrova77/Open-API-Project
   ```

3. Create a `config.js` file in the `js` directory with your API key:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
     API_KEY: "your_api_key_here",
   };
   ```
   Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key from [The Star Wars API](https://www.swapi.tech/).

## Running the Application

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. The application should now be running in your browser. You can use the search functionality to look up Star Wars and navigate through the results.

3. To view the About page, click on the "About" link in the navigation menu or open `about.html` directly in your browser.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main page of the application

  - `index.css`: Styles for the main page
- `js/`
  - `index.js`: JavaScript for the main functionality
